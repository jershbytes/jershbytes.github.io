# Why

Around 2019 I found myself going down a rabbit hole of software after listening to some Podcasts. Mainly [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/), [Destination](http://podcast.destinationlinux.o[...]

## Proton

Proton is like if you want to use Google, but also tell your Government. **NOT TODAY SATAN**.

I've been using them since about 2019 as well going on 5 years and have invested close to $2000 over the years on the sub alone. The reason for the high price is I am locked in on the Visionary Plan. [...]

Proton Currently has 5 soon to be 6 apps in its arsenal.

### [Mail](https://proton.me/mail)

## BitWarden
- Bitwarden has been my go-to Password Manager for about 5 years now. I could honestly not live without this tool. I currently pay them $10 a year for the Premium Plan and has been so worth it. I've a[...]

## Linux

-  Next on this List is my Distro of Choice **Pop!_OS**. Well, It's not privacy-centered exactly it's more focused on security than its upstream OS [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)](https://ubuntu.com/).[...]

## 2FAS
The last one for this First Blog Post is **2FAS**. I use 2FAS as a TOTP app for My Highly sensitive accounts. `E.g. banking, Bitwarden, and Proton accounts`. The reason I have it set up like this as i[...]

# Epilogue 

So here we are at the end of this Post. I enjoyed writing this and telling people what I use to keep myself a little safer on the Internet. I know it's not very detailed and just a run-down but I want[...]
